										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Shah Rukh Khan and Sanjay Leela Bhansali collaborated on the blockbuster film &#8220;Devdas&#8221; 22 years ago. According to the latest reports, the duo is likely to reunite for another film soon. Bhansali initially announced his film &#8220;Inshallah&#8221; with Salman Khan and Alia Bhatt in 2019; however, the film which was slated for a theatrical release in 2020, did not commence shooting. The latest news regarding the film is that Bhansali has put a hold on his dream project &#8220;Baiju Bawra&#8221;, starring Ranveer Singh, as he is now keen on directing &#8220;Inshallah&#8221; with Shah Rukh Khan, according to a report on India.com.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>‘Jawan’, ‘Pathaan’ to compete with Hollywood action films for Vulture’s Stunt Awards</strong><br />
Several Indian media outlets have reported that the &#8220;Dunki&#8221; actor and Bhansali have already had multiple meetings regarding this film. The light-hearted romantic comedy is expected to be made soon. Reports also suggest that the lead female role might be played by Deepika Padukone instead of Alia Bhatt. The storyline of &#8220;Inshallah&#8221; centres on a couple spanning different generations who develop feelings for each other. A man in his forties experiences love for a woman younger than him, prompted by his bedridden father&#8217;s condition. The father decides to transfer his wealth to his son, but with the condition that the son must fall in love and improve his lifestyle as per the father&#8217;s wish. Reports also hint that the production has already begun, and fans might receive the announcement of &#8220;Inshallah&#8221; very soon.</p>

The Shihab Shaheen directorial web-film is scheduled to be released on the popular OTT platform iScreen on November 16.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Poster of the film</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After the immense success of the web-film &#8220;Redrum&#8221;, the Afran Nisho and Mehazabien Chowdhury duo were not seen in any OTT content together. They will however come together for this web-film by Shihab Shaheen. The platform had already revealed the first poster of the film on November 1, on their social media. The poster shows Mehazabien and Nisho standing by the seashore, holding hands, during the twilight hours. Confirming the release, director Shihab Shaheen said, &#8220;The audience will get to see a fantastic story in this film. Besides, Nisho and Mehazabien have a dedicated fan base. I believe that even the general audience will enjoy the content.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>I want to compete with none but myself: Tania Brishty</strong><br />
&#8220;The web-film will center around one of its protagonists – a girl&#8217;s fascination for the sea. When we were shooting this, OTT platforms were not popular. During and post-pandemic it had and has been rising in demand. Also, we had to cancel the shooting of this project four times. Later, this web-film was produced for iScreen,&#8221; the director further added.</p>
